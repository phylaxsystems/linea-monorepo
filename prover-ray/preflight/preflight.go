// Package preflight implements the pre-phase that establishes γ, the shared
// Fiat-Shamir seed the message bus binds every shard against.
//
// [Run] takes the full collection of bus input sets S_1 … S_n — one per shard —
// commits to each with FRI (obtaining Merkle roots R_1 … R_n), maps each root
// into the multiset-hash group, sums them, and compresses the sum to a
// [field.Octuplet]. Because the group operation is commutative, the result does
// not depend on the order the sets are processed in, so no coordinator has to
// impose one.
//
// This runs in the orchestrator, once, before any shard proof is produced — not
// inside a proof. It cannot run inside one: it consumes every shard's data,
// while a shard's prover holds only its own, and a verifier holds none at all.
// The resulting γ is handed to each shard as a public input; see
// [github.com/LFDT-Lineth/lineth-monorepo/prover-ray/zkcdriver/risc5.RegisterSharedRandomness]
// for how it enters a shard proof, and why a shard leaves it unconstrained.
