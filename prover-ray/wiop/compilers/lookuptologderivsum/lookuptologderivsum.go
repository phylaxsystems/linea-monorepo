// Package lookuptologderivsum compiles every unreduced [wiop.TableRelationQuery]
// into a single [wiop.LogDerivativeSum] query whose final result is asserted
// to be zero. It is the prover-ray analogue of linea/prover/protocol/compiler/
// logderivativesum's LookupIntoLogDerivativeSum pass.
//
// The reduction follows the standard log-derivative argument:
//
//   - For each lookup-table fragment T (the "including" side B), commit a
//     multiplicity column M whose value at row i counts how many times that
//     row's value appears across the union of all checked-table A's that
//     reference T.
//
//   - Sample two random extension-field coins:
//
//   - α — used only when the lookup is multi-column, to fold every row
//     into a single field element via random linear combination.
//
//   - γ — used to randomise the denominators (γ + RLC(row)).
//
//   - Emit fractions
//
//     Σ_T  ( −M(row) ) / ( γ + RLC(T(row)) )       (one per T fragment)
//     Σ_S  ( filter_S(row) ) / ( γ + RLC(S(row)) ) (one per A fragment)
//
//     into a single [wiop.LogDerivativeSum] query. The α-randomised RLC
//     binds the multi-column case via Schwartz–Zippel; the γ-randomised
//     denominator makes every Den non-zero with overwhelming probability,
//     which is what closes the zero-denominator soundness gap that the
//     LogDerivativeSum constraint system inherits.
//
//   - Register a verifier action that asserts the LogDerivativeSum's
//     Result cell is zero (the standard log-derivative identity).
//
// B-side filters (selectors on the including side) are folded into the RLC
// itself by prepending the filter to the B-side and a constant 1 to the
// A-side, mirroring linea/lookuptologderivsum's IsFilteredOnIncluding
// handling.
//
// After Compile runs, every consumed [wiop.TableRelationQuery] is marked reduced
// and a single [wiop.LogDerivativeSum] query is left in sys for the
// downstream [logderivativesum] compiler pass to consume.
//
// Scope: the compiler handles inclusion queries with any number of B
// fragments (a lookup table that is the union of fragments). Each B fragment
// gets its own multiplicity column M and its own −M/(γ+RLC) term; the union
// semantics are handled at M-assignment time by a fragment-tagged hash join
// (see [mAssignmentTask]). Multiple A fragments per query and multiple queries
// per shared B side are also supported: queries sharing a B side are bin-packed
// into independent subgroups (each with its own M columns) so that no
// subgroup's summed row count reaches the [wiop.MaxLookupRows] budget, which is
// what keeps large shared tables (e.g. the byte-range tables) provable. See
// [collectGroups]. Permutation queries are ignored.

//
//   - Compile time: each query is checked against the full budget via
//     [wiop.TableRelationQuery.PrecheckRowLimit], which panics immediately if a
//     single query is too big to fit into any subgroup on its own (an A or B
//     side that already reaches the budget alone). That check counts dynamic
//     (or otherwise unsized) modules as their maximum height 2^22, so it is a
//     conservative upper bound.
//
//   - Runtime: one [groupRowLimitAction] per subgroup re-checks the *exact*
//     per-run heights, summed across the whole subgroup, on both the prover
//     (panic) and verifier (error) sides. This is the check that enforces the
//     shared budget now that a subgroup — not a single query — is the unit that
//     shares a multiplicity column M and its accumulators: the subgroup's whole
//     A side (the union of all its A fragments) and its B side (the shared
//     lookup table) must each stay strictly below [wiop.MaxLookupRows].
//     Compile-time bin-packing (see collectGroups) keeps every subgroup under
//     budget using static heights, and this runtime action re-verifies it for
//     the concrete witness, so a dynamic module that grew unexpectedly cannot
//     slip an over-budget subgroup past the verifier.
//
// The subgroup action is registered on the subgroup's witness round, ahead of
// the M-assignment task that compileGroup later places on the same round, so an
// over-budget subgroup fails before M is filled.

// collectGroups walks sys.TableRelations once, picks out every unreduced
// inclusion query, buckets them by the canonical identity of their B side, and
// then bin-packs each bucket into one or more subgroups.
//
// Bin-packing is the crux of the row-limit fix. Every subgroup carries its own
// multiplicity column M per B fragment and therefore drains the full
// [wiop.MaxLookupRows] budget independently — proving S ⊆ T for a subset of the
// bucket's lookups is a self-contained log-derivative identity. So instead of
// forcing every lookup that shares a table T into one group (whose shared M made
// the per-lookup budget shrink as MaxLookupRows / lookupCount, which is what
// broke lookups against large tables such as the byte-range tables), we greedily
// accumulate lookups into a subgroup and open a fresh one whenever the next
// lookup would push the subgroup's static A-side row total to the budget.
//
// Three invariants are established here and relied on by [compileGroup]:
//
//   - one multiplicity column M per B fragment *per subgroup* — this is what
//     lets each subgroup's B-side sum cancel the union of its own A-side sums
//     in the final log-derivative identity;
//
//   - a subgroup's static A-side row total (dynamic modules counted as their
//     2^22 maximum) stays strictly below [wiop.MaxLookupRows], so at runtime —
//     where module heights only ever shrink — every multiplicity M fits well
//     inside the field and the reduced accumulators cannot overflow;
//
//   - each subgroup's witnessRound is the latest round across every column it
//     touches (the shared B fragments and every A fragment of every query in
//     the subgroup), so M can be allocated on a round where all its inputs are
//     already committed and *before* the α/γ coin round.
//
// A single query is always kept whole inside one subgroup: all of its A
// fragments land together, which keeps the per-query row-limit check (see
// [registerRowLimitChecks]) meaningful. A query too big to fit any subgroup on
// its own is caught there at compile time.
