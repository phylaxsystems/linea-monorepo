// buildSingleDirectionShard builds a self-contained shard whose single handle
// carries exactly one entry — either a Send or a Receive — and drives it to a
// product value.
//
// Because a shard that only sends (resp. only receives) can never balance on
// its own, the entry is marked [wiop.MessageBus.SkipInShardCheck] so the
// compiler does NOT register the in-shard "product == 1" assertion. The shard's
// GrandProduct Result is therefore left live and unasserted: it holds this
// shard's partial product on the handle, to be joined with sibling shards.
//
//   - A Send-only shard produces Result = ∏send folds (numerator only).
//   - A Receive-only shard produces Result = 1 / ∏recv folds (denominator only).
//
// Every shard registers [setupMessageBusHook], seeding Fiat–Shamir with the
// shared testMessageBusSeed so α and β are IDENTICAL across shards — the
// precondition that makes the per-shard folds comparable and their products
// joinable. This mirrors the production cross-shard layer, which feeds every
// shard the same shared randomness.
