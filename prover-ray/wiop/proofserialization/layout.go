package proofserialization

// This file mirrors verifier-ray's proof ABI: the sizes, field offsets and
// discriminant values that the image is built from.
//
// verifier-ray/src/proof_abi.zig is the authority. It asserts these numbers
// against the Zig types at compile time, so Zig's layout cannot move out from
// under them silently. abi_agreement_test.go checks the other direction — that
// the numbers here still match the ones pinned there — because a pin updated on
// one side only would produce an image that still casts cleanly while the
// verifier reads misplaced bytes.
//
// Nothing here may be inferred from the Go struct layouts in types.go: Go orders
// its own fields and would disagree.

// Type sizes, in bytes. Identical on aarch64, x86_64 and the rv64 guest.
