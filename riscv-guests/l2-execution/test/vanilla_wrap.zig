//! Shared "dummy-fill" bridge: wraps a VANILLA EF stateless input (schema 0x0001) into an extended
//! `L2ExecutionProofPrivateInput` (schema 0x0002) so the extended l2-execution guest can run on the
//! same corpus the vanilla guest runs on (the EF execution-spec-tests zkevm fixtures).
//!
//! Real wiring: `test/extended_vanilla_runner.zig` calls this in-process (host reference-test
//! guard).
//!
//! Dummy-fill choices (see `runL2Execution`'s conflation invariants in l2_execution.zig):
//!   - `payloads`: a single payload whose `stateless_input_ssz` is the vanilla bytes VERBATIM
//!     (zero-copy) and `forced_transactions` empty — a single payload trivially satisfies the
//!     parentHash-chaining / baseFee-constant checks (there's only one block in the "range").
//!   - `chain_config.chain_id`: copied from the vanilla input's own `chain_config.chain_id`, so the
//!     `ChainIdMismatch` check (which compares the payload's chain_id against this field) passes.
//!   - `chain_config.coinbase`: copied from the vanilla payload's `fee_recipient`, so the
//!     `FeeRecipientMismatch` check passes.
//!   - `chain_config.l2_message_service_address`: `DUMMY_L2_MESSAGE_SERVICE_ADDRESS` below, the zero
//!     address. This is not an arbitrary placeholder: it's the sentinel `runL2Execution` recognizes
//!     as "no L2MessageService configured" and responds to by suppressing the L1<->L2 bridge reads
//!     entirely (both boundary rolling hashes and message numbers pinned to zero, no L2->L1 message
//!     extraction) rather than attempting a witness-backed read that EF fixtures — which carry no
//!     L2MessageService account and no post-state witness coverage — cannot satisfy. See
//!     `l2_execution.zig`'s `bridge_suppressed` handling and its Python mirror in
//!     `rollup_spec/l2_execution.py`.
//!   - `parent_ftx_rolling_hash` / `parent_last_processed_ftx_number`: zero — there is no prior
//!     range, so both start at their genesis values.
